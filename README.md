*Open source, privacy friendly email app for Android*

This open source, privacy friendly email app might be for you if your current email app:

* takes long to receive or to show messages
* can manage only one email address
* cannot handle a large number of messages
* cannot show conversations
* cannot work offline
* looks outdated
* is not maintained and supported
* stores your email on their servers
* is closed source, potentially violating your privacy

This app is minimalistic by design, so you can concentrate on reading and writing messages.

This app starts a foreground service with a low priority status bar notification to make sure you'll never miss new email.

## What I changed in this fork

* Signal color for dark theme
* For zoom = 0 font size of sender and subject is the same, for 1 and 2 font size of subject ist smaller then font size of sender
* In detail view
    - date and size is on one line
    - color of date, size and subject in header detail info is colorUnread
    - font size of subject in header block is one step larger
    - When opening an email the subject in the email list element is hidden
    - date, size and subject will be always shown in header detail info, even when choosing the option to hide the header detail infos on opening the email

* [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/eu.faircode.email/) ([last build status](https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/eu.faircode.email/lastbuild))

Note that F-Droid builds new versions irregularly and you'll need the F-Droid client to get update notifications.
To get updates in a timely fashion you are advised to use the GitHub release.
The GitHub release will automatically check for updates on GitHub.
You can turn this off in the advanced options.

Because F-Droid builds and GitHub releases are signed differently, an F-Droid build needs to be uninstalled first to be able to update to a GitHub release.

## Privacy

Please see [here](https://github.com/M66B/open-source-email/blob/master/PRIVACY.md#fairemail) for the privacy policy.

## Compatibility

FairEmail requires at least Android 5 Lollipop.
Individual message notifications are available on Android 7 Nougat and later only
because earlier Android versions do not support notification grouping.

FairEmail will work properly on devices without any Google service installed.

See [here](https://github.com/M66B/open-source-email/blob/master/FAQ.md#known-problems) for known problems.
